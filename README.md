# whoami

A single-page site that shows the information a browser and network reveals when you visit a page. It is designed to be deployed to GitHub Pages so visitors can quickly see details like their IP, approximate IP-based location, device and browser fingerprinting surface, and optional geolocation API results.

Just publish this repository via GitHub Pages and open the site. All data is collected in the browser using public APIs; IP-based enrichment uses the free `ipapi.co` JSON endpoint.
